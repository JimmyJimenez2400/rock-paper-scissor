# rock-paper-scissor! GO!

This application allows the user to select from three choices in order to compete against a computer. The technology I used were simply HTML, CSS, JS. Challenges I faced were understanding what I needed to know, how to implement a function, call the function, and starting the game as well. Some future features that I would love to add is a better UI, more eye-friendly, dark-mode, and one feature you can go against people online but that will take time so I'll save it for later.

The motivation to comeplete this project was to learn and practice on what I hav previously learned. Building this project would give me a feel of what it would be like to be in a team. Showcasing my skills as they improve. The problems that I solved during this was understanding what query selectors, event listeners, add and remove, etc... I learned how valuable it is to read documentation, googling on stuff I am not familar with. My project stands out, well this is the first project that really challenged me.
